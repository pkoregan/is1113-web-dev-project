        The age of subscriptions is upon us! Over the past few years the standards
        of how we license software has started to change from once off license
        payments to subscription basis whereby the user pays for their software
        with yearly or monthy paymnets. This spreads out the cost of software
        licenses for the user and, most importantly, this also puts,and end
        to the use of out of date software. Paying for software on a subscription 
        basis means that the user no longer just purchases one version of the software
        but they now get regular updates to ensure they always have access to the best
        and most up to date features.
